# This file allows you to exclude specific security checks

# Exclude the customer-managed key check for development environments

# which is sufficient for most use cases
exclude:
  - google-storage-bucket-encryption-customer-key
# You can also exclude other checks if needed:
# exclude:
#   - google-storage-bucket-encryption-customer-key
#   - another-check-id
